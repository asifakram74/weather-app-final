#  Weather


## What is Weather ?

Weather is a simple app that displays weather in SwiftUI. I saw a lot of tutorials on the web, that shows very basic feature of SwiftUI. I tried to combine all of them in one simple app to demonstrate how SwiftUI works. It shows asynchronous data fetch, binding and how to build user interfaces with SwiftUI.

## Installation

### Open Weather Map

Weather uses the [Open Weather Map](https://api.openweathermap.org) to fetch weather data. To run this app, you'll need a Open Weather API key. This is entirely free. To do so :
1. Create your account [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your API key.

Once you get your key :
1. Go to the `.env` file.
2. Replace `REACT_APP_API_KEY = ""` by your key.
